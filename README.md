<h1 align="center">Hi, This is Jasmine 👋</h1>
<b>I'm currently diving deep into Machine Learning, AI, and Data Visualization as a Master's student at Indiana University Bloomington. My journey started with a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Anna University, where I developed a keen interest in blending solid engineering principles with the dynamic world of data science.

I thrive on turning complex data puzzles into clear, actionable insights using an arsenal of tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. Whether I’m forecasting financial markets or building advanced healthcare diagnostics, my goal is always to uncover patterns that speak volumes. Passionate about the magic of machine learning and AI, I’m all about developing innovative solutions that not only solve problems but also inspire change.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in chatting about data science innovations or collaborating on projects that aim to transform industries through data!<b>
